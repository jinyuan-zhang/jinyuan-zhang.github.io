# About Me
<p style="text-align:justify">
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Finance Department at <a href="https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/academic-areas/finance" target="_blank">INSEAD</a>. My research interests lie in the area of financial intermediation, including banking, pension funds, and mutual funds. I study the impact of macro-level policies on micro-level behaviors and the subsequent economic consequences.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">I am advised by Prof. <a href="https://faculty.insead.edu/joel-peress/home" target="_blank">Joel Peress</a>, Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/idrechsl/" target="_blank">Itamar Drechsler</a> ,  Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/johnkuongkcf/home" target="_blank">John Kuong</a>, and Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/guillaumevuillemey/home" target="_blank">Guillaume Vuillemey</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">I am on the job market and available for virtual interviews at the 2021 AEA/ASSA/AFA/EEA annual meetings.</p>
