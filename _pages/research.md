**Job Market Paper:**
* **Public Pension Deficits and Bank Deposits**<br/>

      <summary>Abstract: (click) </summary>
      This paper examines the effect of pension deficits on the real economy through households' capital allocation between bank deposits and capital market investment. I first show that higher pension deficits lead to more bank deposits and less capital market investments. The causal effect is identified through exploiting cross-sectional variations in U.S. state public pension deficits, and the quasi-exogenous shock of GASB rule changes. I then study pension deficits' impacts on the real economy of other states using staggered state pension reforms, which induce deposits withdrawals from households to reduce deficits. Such a shift causes significantly shrinkage on banks' liabilities and assets. Consequently, banks exposed to pension reforms cut lending to small business in the states which do not pass pension reforms, scaling down new establishments and employment in these states. Overall, I identify the negative economic spillover effects of states with public pension reforms on those without, through households' reallocation of capital away from banks.
