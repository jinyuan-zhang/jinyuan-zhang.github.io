          This paper identifies the effects of US state public pension deficits on the economy through altering households' allocation of savings between bank deposits and stocks. Employing a "contiguous border county" strategy and exploiting quasi-exogenous accounting rule updates, I find that a worsening of pension deficits induces households to reallocate savings from stocks to bank deposits. I further examine the economic implications of pension deficits using staggered state pension reforms. Reforms that reduce pension deficits lead households to withdraw deposits, which erodes banks' balance sheets and generates negative economic externalities in non--pension-reforming states through the bank lending channel.

            This paper examines the flow patterns in corporate bond mutual funds under different monetary policy environment. We build a model of runs in funds with uncertain future interest rate, uncovering a novel outflow-to-interest-rate relationship. Consistent with the model’s predictions, we empirically find that outflows from funds increases when the fed funds target rate increases, the outflow-to-rate sensitivity is stronger under more accommodative and uncertain monetary policy environment, and these monetary-policy-induced flow sensitivities are greater when bond market is more liquid. Our results suggest that fragility in corporate bond funds could be an important unintended consequence of monetary policy.

            This paper uncovers a novel phenomenon, flight-to-Bitcoin, during heightened policy uncertainties. Panel regressions show that countries witness higher Bitcoin (BTC) premia, turnovers, and web traffic on cryptocurrency exchanges as local economic policy uncertainties surge. Difference-in-differences tests exploiting nation-wide shocks further confirm the pattern. The observed phenomenon is primarily motivated by the lack of confidence in local authorities and investors' risk aversion, instead of the circumvention of capital controls or the hedging demand against market crashes. We argue that the stateless and decentralized feature of BTC qualifies it as an alternative investment vehicle to allay concerns against local authorities amid turbulence.

            This paper develops a structural model to examine high-frequency price dynamics. The key innovation is to allow trades' permanent price impact to be time-varying—dynamic trade informativeness. A distribution-free filtering technique pins the real-world data to the model. The filtered series significantly recover the efficient price innovation through the dynamics of trade informativeness, improve trades' explanatory power for future returns, distinguish informativeness from trades' aggressiveness, gauge informed investors' patience, and capture systematic patterns around scheduled and unscheduled events, as well as general intraday trends. The framework contributes to the better utilization of high-frequency trading data.

      We provide a theoretical framework necessary to understand the implications of corporate governance in the composition of the asset management industry. In our model all investors can (i) decide to be active (informed) or passive (uninformed), (ii) trade in the financial market, and (iii) engage in corporate governance. We find that including corporate governance in an, otherwise standard, information model creates new strategic complementarities in investors' decisions to become active or passive. This result is robust to the various approaches that passive investors can take with respect to corporate governance. The strategic complementarities give rise to an increase in the proportion of passive investors in equilibrium, which can rationalize the rising of passive investment in the asset management industry. Moreover, we generate testable predictions on price informativeness, return volatility and product competition to test the influence of corporate governance gains affect investors' decisions to become active or passive.

    [6]. <strong>The Rise of Passive Funds Triggers Active Fund Consolidation</strong><br>
    <ul>
    <li>Summary: The rise of passive investing can trigger active funds to consolidate (T) </li>
    <li>Conferences: 2018 CICF, 2018 TADC</li>
    <li><details>
          <summary>Abstract: (click) </summary>
      Consolidation among active asset management funds surged in 2016. What triggered this new wave of consolidation? Using a noisy rational expectation model with imperfect competition, we show that the rise of passive investing can explain the new change. As the number of passive funds grows, the asset market becomes more liquid. As a result, the rents extracted from noise traders shrink and the competition among active funds becomes more intense. These effects squeeze down the expected profit margins of active funds, hence stimulating them to form a coalition to gain monopolistic trading power. I show that the rise of passive investing affects market outcomes (liquidity, price informativeness and volatility) through fund consolidation, and hence it is essential to control for active funds consolidation when examining the (casual) relationship between passive investing and market outcomes.
