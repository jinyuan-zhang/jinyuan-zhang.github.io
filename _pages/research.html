          US public state pension deficits are massive, accounting for 18.5% of an average state's GDP and up to 50% in Illinois. Since taxpayers must pay these debts, deficits potentially influence their savings choices. Comparing households living on opposing sides of a state's border, I find that households in larger-deficit states take less risk, saving less in stocks and more in bank deposits. Moreover, I show that these differences narrow after states pass pension reforms that significantly reduce their liabilities. The aggregate impact of households' savings allocation is seen in local economic activity: following a state pension reform, households' deposit withdrawals cause banks to cut lending in non--pension-reforming states, generating negative economic externalities in these states. </p>

            This paper examines flow patterns in corporate bond mutual funds under different monetary policy environments. We build a model of runs in funds with uncertain future interest rates, uncovering a novel outflow-to-interest-rate relationship. Consistent with the model's predictions, we empirically find that (1) outflows from funds increase when the target Fed funds rate increases, (2) the outflow-to-interest-rate sensitivity is stronger under more accommodative and uncertain monetary policy environments, and (3) these monetary-policy-induced flow sensitivities are greater when the bond market is more liquid. Our results suggest that fragility in corporate bond funds could be an important unintended consequence of monetary policy.

            This paper uncovers a novel phenomenon, flight-to-Bitcoin, during heightened policy uncertainties. Panel regressions show that countries witness higher Bitcoin (BTC) premia, turnovers, and web traffic on cryptocurrency exchanges as local economic policy uncertainties surge. Difference-in-differences tests exploiting nation-wide shocks further confirm the pattern. The observed phenomenon is primarily motivated by the lack of confidence in local authorities and investors' risk aversion, instead of the circumvention of capital controls or the hedging demand against market crashes. We argue that the stateless and decentralized feature of BTC qualifies it as an alternative investment vehicle to allay concerns against local authorities amid turbulence.

            This paper develops a structural model to examine high-frequency price dynamics. The key innovation is to allow trades' permanent price impact to be time-varying—dynamic trade informativeness. A distribution-free filtering technique pins the real-world data to the model. The filtered series (i) significantly recover the efficient price innovation through the dynamics of trade informativeness, (ii) improve trades' explanatory power for future returns, (iii) distinguish informativeness from trades' aggressiveness, (iv) gauge informed investors' patience, and (v) capture systematic patterns around scheduled and unscheduled events, as well as general intraday trends. The framework contributes to the better utilization of high-frequency trading data.         </p>

          We provide a theoretical framework to understand the implications of institutional activism for the composition of the asset management industry.
          Including institutional activism in an, otherwise standard, information model gives rise to a conflict of interest among investors, generating new strategic complementarities in investors' information acquisition decisions.
          Such strategic complementarities lead to an increase in the proportion of passive investors in equilibrium, which can rationalize the rising share of passive investment.
          Our results are robust to the various approaches that passive investors can take to engage in institutional activism. Moreover, we generate testable predictions on price informativeness, return volatility, and product competition to test the implications of institutional activism.         </p>

    [6]. <strong>The Rise of Passive Funds Triggers Active Fund Consolidation</strong><br>
    <ul>
    <li>Summary: The rise of passive investing can trigger active funds to consolidate (T) </li>

          <summary>Abstract: (click) </summary>
      Consolidation among active asset management funds surged in 2016. What triggered this new wave of consolidation? Using a noisy rational expectation model with imperfect competition, we show that the rise of passive investing can explain the new change. As the number of passive funds grows, the asset market becomes more liquid. As a result, the rents extracted from noise traders shrink and the competition among active funds becomes more intense. These effects squeeze down the expected profit margins of active funds, hence stimulating them to form a coalition to gain monopolistic trading power. I show that the rise of passive investing affects market outcomes (liquidity, price informativeness and volatility) through fund consolidation, and hence it is essential to control for active funds consolidation when examining the (casual) relationship between passive investing and market outcomes.
